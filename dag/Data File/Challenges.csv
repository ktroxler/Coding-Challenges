1,Saturday,01/11/2020,Daily Coding Problem <founders@dailycodingproblem.com>,Daily Coding Problem: Problem #418 [Easy] ,"*Coding Challenge* 

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Atlassian.

MegaCorp wants to give bonuses to its employees based on how many lines of codes
they have written. They would like to give the smallest positive amount to each
worker consistent with the constraint that if a developer has written more lines
of code than their neighbor, they should receive more money.

Given an array representing a line of seats of employees at MegaCorp, determine
how much each one should get paid.

For example, given [10, 40, 200, 1000, 60, 30], you should return [1, 2, 3, 4,
2, 1].

This problem was asked by Google.

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y+1),
    (x+1,y-1)


You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the
points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start
from the first point.

Example:

Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output: 2


It takes 1 step to move from (0, 0) to (1, 1). It takes one more step to move
from (1, 1) to (1, 2).

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Affirm.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in
chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you
could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number 
fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many
transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and fee = 2, you should return 9, since
you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4
dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4
dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps
at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you
can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

 * 2, 1, 1
 * 1, 2, 1
 * 1, 1, 2
 * 2, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb
any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you
could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given an array X of floating-point numbers x1, x2, ... xn. These can be
rounded up or down to create a corresponding array Y of integers y1, y2, ... yn.

Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate Y array with the following
properties:

 * The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.
 * The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other
   words, |x1- y1| + |x2- y2| + ... + |xn- yn| should be as small as possible.

For example, suppose your input is [1.3, 2.3, 4.4]. In this case you cannot do
better than [1, 2, 5], which has an absolute difference of |1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2|

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different
websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to
assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to
that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain
count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined
as :

score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) /
Cz))

Here, Sx, Sy, ..., Sz denote the scores of all the other sites that have
outgoing links to Sj, and d is a damping factor, usually set to around 0.85,
used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that
calculates each site's page rank.

32,Sunday,12/29/2019,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,How To Ask Great Questions At Your PM Interview  ,"*Product Management Prep* 

One of the most important yet overlooked parts of interviewing is when the
interviewer gives you an opportunity to ask them questions. For product
management interviews, This is one of the most critical parts of an interview
and sets the tone for their excitement as soon as the interview is over.

Here's our recommended way to structure your questions so you can come off as an
ideal candidate. You should ask one question relating to each of the following
three categories:

 1. Interviewer specific question.
 2. Team specific question.
 3. Organization-Industry specific question.

This structure guarantees you show personal interest, team interest, and
organizational interest. It also shows you've done your research and you
understand problems the organization faces. Asking deeper questions also helps
show the interviewer you are intentional in your job search.

INTERVIEWER SPECIFIC QUESTION
The first question you should ask is related to your interviewer. No — you don't
ask their favorite color or what they like doing on the weekend. Here you should
research your interviewer on LinkedIn and see what their previous experience was
like. Is there anything that stands out? Ask questions relating to how specific
experiences they've had has influenced their execution or their current
position. This also helps to disarm your interviewer and immediately creates
rapport.

Here are three questions you could ask:

 * Before joining Uber I noticed you also worked at an early stage startup. How
   was the transition and what do you wish you knew before making that
   transition?
 * What has your design background offered you that you wished other PMs at Yelp
   paid more attention to?
 * I noticed you also have some entrepreneurial experience from Juicebox. I'm
   curious how you've translated your startup/entrepeneurial experience into
   influencing the Product culture at Twitter.

Again, be meticulous in your research so you can ask pointed questions about how
their experience has influenced their current situations.

TEAM SPECIFIC QUESTION
Here, you'll want to ask questions specifically about the team you'll be working
with. This includes culture questions or more specific questions about
organizational structure within your team. These can be specific or high-level.
These can also include more objective and informational questions.

Here are some sample questions you could ask:

 * I heard that the PMs have been moved to the same floor to help with
   cross-unit collaboration — what is the biggest difference you've noticed
   since this change in terms of team collaboration?
 * How has the Developer Success team evolved over the past couple years as more
   focus has been placed on the Twitch API? How do you see it changing as the
   team grows?
 * Who will be on the core and extended team for this role? Is it only
   developers or also designers?

These types of questions are easy and show immediate interest in the team you'll
be working with on a daily basis. This also helps you identify important
cultural norms that exist within the team to emmulate during your interviews.

ORGANIZATION-INDUSTRY SPECIFIC QUESTION
We usually recommend saving this one for last as it's your ""home-run ball"".
These types of questions show deep understanding and interest in the product,
industry, and organization at a high level. You should research specific trends
in the industry, look at how the organization is tackling these challenges, and
form a specific opinion on whether it's the right or wrong strategy. Don't worry
about coming off too dense — you'll never have as much information as your
interviewer since you don't have access to proprietary and private data.

Here are three great questions some of our subscribers have asked:

 * How do you think MLBAM's recent exclusivity rights to competitive League of
   Legends affects how Twitch approaches the esports category given the
   increasing investment into broadcast rights for esports?
 * With features like Open set to roll out, are there other ways SeatGeek is
   planning to tackle the issue of customer trust in an opaque ticketing
   industry?
 * I noticed Oculus has a more closed ecosystem when compared to other platform
   liks the HTC Vive platform or Microsoft's VR platform. Obviously you get to
   control the initial experience and direction of the marketplace, but I'm
   curious how you are approaching the potential risk of ceding share to
   competitors and why the platform team felt this was the best long term
   strategy

These types of questions help communicate deep interest and understanding in the
industry and product. It also shows your ability to think strategically while
being outside of the organization.

Nailing the interview is hard enough. Don't forget to prepare great questions
for each interview you have. This helps round out your interview and leave a
lasting impression to each person you speak with.

Good luck!

Hope your day is going well! I wrote a post on how to prepare for your first
product management interview. Approaching your first product interview can be
overwhelming and confusing. Hopefully these tips help you gain confidence and
help you prepare to nail your interviews.

Whether you're a graduating student looking at product roles, an engineer
looking for a change, someone in growth/support or anyone else in between,
preparing for your first product management interview is incredibly important.

To be blunt, product interviews are hard and the process is long. Be prepared to
spend 3 – 6 rounds of multiple 1+ hour interviews whether you're applying for an
APM position or a regular Product position. Additionally, the last round at most
product organizations have what's informally known as a 'super-day', aka
multiple hour long interviews jammed into one session. This can be extremely
daunting and overwhelming. However, with enough mock interview practice and a
few other tips we promise it will be much more approachable!

In this post, we'll provide a few tips to help you prepare for your first
product management interview. We'll split our tips into three distinct
categories:

 1. Answering the basics
 2. Remaining focused, confident, and sharp
 3. Leveraging your previous role

These are practical tips that will help you feel less overwhelmed when
approaching your first product management interview. They'll help you execute in
a concise manner, learn from past interviews, and leverage your experience
effectively based on your previous role.

ANSWERING THE BASICS
At a high level, product interviews repeatedly test three things:

 1. Your ability to communicate succinctly, convincingly, and with structure
 2. Your ability to empathize with users and execute on product process
 3. Your ability to collaborate in cross-functional teams

Because of this, there's a few questions you should almost always expect to
hear. The bad news is they're oftentimes quite difficult. The good news is that
since you're expecting them, you can prepare answers ahead of time and treat
these as ""freebies"". Failing on these types of questions will therefore be from
your own lack of preparation rather than difficulty.

Here are the types of questions you should expect and guidance on how to answer
them:

 * Tell me about yourself. This question tests your ability to to communicate
   succinctly and with structure. Typically you want this answer to be no longer
   than 3 minutes. Focus on structure and be chronological to help articulate a
   clear story. You can glaze over certain topics to bait your interviewer into
   asking you about specific experiences later in the product interview.
   
   
 * Why X company? This question once again tests your ability to communicate. We
   recommend having three clear and concise reasons why you're interested in the
   particular company. You should not spend more than 1 minute explaining your
   reasoning. You should be able to concisely articulate your reasonings. Part
   of being a product manager is to be convincing in a short period of time to
   achieve buy-in. This is the perfect question to showcase this skill.
   
   
 * Why leave your previous company / Why product management? If you're switching
   companies they may ask you why you're leaving your previous gig. If you're
   switching into product from a different role they'll ask why the switch.
   Similar to the above, you should have 3 clear reasons, be convincing, and be
   concise. No more than 1 minute for the entire solution.
   
   
 * Product based questions. We won't go over every product question in this post
   (they're all covered in Daily Product Prep) however you should know, off the
   top of your head, answers to at least these three specific questions: What is
   your favorite product? What is your least favorite product? and Improve our
   product. During the process you're almost 100% going to have to answer some
   variations of all three of these questions. Be prepared by having concise and
   clear answers to each of these.
   
   

Leverage mock interviews with friends or colleagues when preparing for your
interviews and make sure to go through all of the above questions multiple
times. Refine your answers after feedback from each mock product interview
session.

REMAINING FOCUSED, CONFIDENT, AND SHARP
A mixture of length and intensity can cause product interviews to be incredibly
draining. You don't want to slip up halfway through your interview due to
fatigue. Follow these tips to help maintain confidence and acuteness during your
product management interviews:

 * Prepare with product based questions. One way to be prepared for the length
   of the product interview is to be drilled and rehearsed in all product based
   questions. This makes you more comfortable and approachable throughout the
   process. It's like studying for an exam - rigor and discipline goes a long
   way!
   
   
 * Whiteboard during mock interviews. A large part of product interviews will be
   spent on the whiteboard. Simulating a true interview environment during your
   mocks includes whiteboarding. This helps you set a pace for your answers
   since whiteboarding solutions can oftentimes take up more time than you
   initially anticipated.
   
   
 * One question won't kill you. Product interviews are long. You won't nail
   every question. If you're starting to fall flat on a question, that's totally
   normal. You won't be perfect at every question so after answering, let the
   question go. You're here to show confidence and resilience. Being able to
   recover from a poor answer is incredibly important.
   
   
 * Use the bathroom. Using the bathroom in between interviews can help you catch
   your breath and refocus. This tactic can be used after every interview if
   needed. This gives you a physical and private space to literally put the past
   interview behind you so you can regain focus and reset your mind. It's easy
   to be overwhelmed and suffocated by the intensity of back-to-back-to-back
   interviews, so finding effective ways to catch your breath and refocus is
   critical to consistently performing well.
   
   
 * You can't win them all. You won't get offers from every firm you interview
   at. That's totally ok. Remain confident and use each interview as a learning
   opportunity and interview prep for future interviews. Take time after each
   interview to evaluate how to improve. This may include tweaking your answers
   based on feedback (both what's said and inferring from body language) from
   previous interviews. Have a mental log on how long each answer takes and try
   to tighten answers that are too long.
   
   

LEVERAGING YOUR PREVIOUS ROLE
If you're trying to transition into product from a different role you should
leverage your past experiences as much as possible to articulate why you'd be a
good fit despite lacking product experience. Here are key items to leverage
based on your previous role:

 * Engineering. Working cross-functionally with product managers and designers.
   By working cross functionally with your past product managers and designers,
   you can articulate how you understand the process from each side. Also, by
   having worked with product managers closely in the past, you have a leg up in
   understanding the required process to succeed. Another added benefit is your
   ability to empathize with future engineers on your team since you've worked
   in a development team before.
   
   
 * Design. As a designer, use experiences that showcases your user focus and
   capabilities in testing. Your greatest asset is your ability to rigorously
   understand your users and build products that cater to their wants and needs.
   Also, by working closely with product managers in the past you can leverage
   how you understand product process, your experience working with developers,
   and how to achieve buy-in upstream.
   
   
 * Growth / marketing. People in growth roles have a penchant for executing to
   hit aggressive targets. Use this experience to help articulate how you would
   get your team to execute effectively on tight deadlines and constrained
   resources. You should also speak on how part of hitting targets is the art of
   setting targets. This can be used to create parallels with how setting
   targets is similar to selecting key metrics to measure success.
   
   
 * Sales. Your greatest asset from sales is your ability to achieve buy-in and
   sell an idea to a larger crowd. As a product manager you need to be able to
   convince stakeholders not only of big ideas, but of tradeoffs during
   development. Leverage how your ability to sell a product translates into
   achieving organizational buy-in at all levels.
   
   
 * Data science. A large part of a product manager's job is to quantify and
   measure the success of their products. Leveraging your ability to use data to
   inform decision making is a huge asset. Use specific examples in the past
   where you've set up and executed A/B tests and multivariate tests. You should
   also speak on how you've helped organizations select which metrics best
   represent success.
   
   
 * Customer success. If you're coming from customer success, you should
   continually reiterate the fact that you empathize with users. The most
   practical experience you have transitioning into product from a support role
   is the wealth of time you've spent talking to and understanding users. Try to
   come up with specific examples from your experience where you've demonstrated
   empathy and how you've helped solve user issues.
   
   
 * Finance / accounting. Your familiarity with numbers and process is a huge
   asset as a product manager. Product managers need to use metrics and data to
   achieve buy-in consistently. Another asset from more finance roles is your
   ability to create informative and impactful decks. Many product interviews
   have a data or product take-home assignemtn where you can leverage your deck
   creation skills.
   
   
 * Student. As a student the most important experience to leverage is any
   entreprenurial or club experience you've had where you've shown the ability
   to execute on uncertain information. For example, if you've founded a club,
   started a side business, or led projects with different types of people. Go
   into detail on how you were able to make logical decisions in the face of
   uncertain information.
   
   

Leveraging your previous role is important and each role offers different value
to product at any organization. Focus on specific experiences that would make
you the ideal product manager. Remember: you got this!

Good luck on your interviews!

The h-index is a metric used to measure the impact and productivity of a
scientist or researcher.

A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of their _N_ papers have at least _h_ citations
each, and the other N - h papers have no more than _h_ citations each. If there
are multiple possible values for _h_, the maximum value is used.

Given an array of natural numbers, with each value representing the number of
citations of a researcher's paper, return the h-index of that researcher.

For example, if the array was:

[4, 0, 0, 2, 3]


This means the researcher has 5 papers with 4, 1, 0, 2, and 3 citations
respectively. The h-index for this researcher is 2, since they have 2 papers
with at least 2 citations and the remaining 3 papers have no more than 2

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the
secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number
with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds
by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the
secret code. For example, if the secret code were 123456, then a guess of 175286 
would score two, since 1 and 6 were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores,
determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return True, since they
correspond to the secret code 123456:

{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}

Soundex [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex] is an algorithm used to
categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled
differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers,
like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

 1. Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change ck ->
    c).
 2. Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the
    string.
 3. Remove all vowels, including y, w, and h.
 4. Replace all consonants with the following digits: * b, f, p, v → 1
     * c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z →
       2
     * d, t → 3
     * l → 4
     * m, n → 5
     * r → 6
    
    
 5. If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the
    first three numbers.

Using this scheme, Jackson and Jaxen both map to J250.

Implement Soundex.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up
to three children. Here is an example which represents the words code, cob, be, 
ax, war, and we.

       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  


The tree is structured according to the following rules:

 * left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent
   prefix
 * right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent
   prefix
 * middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since code is the first word inserted in the tree, and cob 
lexicographically precedes cod, cob is represented as a left child extending
from cod.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities
around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in
the list has the format (source_city, destination, price).

Consider a user who is willing to take up to k connections from their origin
city A to their destination B. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey
and print the itinerary for that journey.

For example, our traveler wants to go from JFK to LAX with up to 3 connections,
and our input flights are as follows:

[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),

    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]


Due to some improbably low flight prices, the cheapest itinerary would be JFK ->
ATL -> ORD -> LAX, costing $440.

reduce (also known as fold) is a function that takes in an array, a combining
function, and an initial value and builds up a result by calling the combining
function on each element of the array, left to right. For example, we can write 
sum() in terms of reduce:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def sum(lst):
    return reduce(lst, add, 0)


This should call add on the initial value with the first element of the array,
and then the result of that with the second element of the array, and so on
until we reach the end, when we return the sum of the array.

Implement your own version of reduce.

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find
the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given
dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

 * It can be found in the dictionary
 * It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the
   board
 * The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not
   diagonally).

Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }


and matrix:

[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]


Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and
'rat' without them touching each other. We could have alternatively made 'eat'
and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different
websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to
assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to
that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain
count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined
as :

score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) /
Cz))

Here, Sx, Sy, ..., Sz denote the scores of all the other sites that have
outgoing links to Sj, and d is a damping factor, usually set to around 0.85,
used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that
calculates each site's page rank.

For example, suppose listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20], and towers = [4, 8, 15]. In
this case the minimum range would be 5, since that would be required for the
tower at position 15 to reach the listener at position 20.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the
numbers 0 through 9 in order. Each of these wheels rotate clockwise and
counterclockwise.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of ""dead ends"", meaning that if you
turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that
state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a ""move"" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in
either direction. Given a lock initially set to 000, a target combination, and a
list of dead ends, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves
required to reach the target state, or None if this is impossible.

There are M people sitting in a row of N seats, where M < N. Your task is to

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
where 0 represents an empty seat and 1 represents a person. In this case, one
solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can
consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each
person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Each student can be placed in a friend group, which can be defined as the
transitive closure of that student's friendship relations. In other words, this
is the smallest set such that no student in the group has any friends outside
this group. For the example above, the friend groups would be {0, 1, 2, 5}, {3,
6}, {4}.

Given a friendship list such as the one above, determine the number of friend
groups in the class.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four
bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010
10101100. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

 * For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
 * For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The
   other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

A network consists of nodes labeled 0 to N. You are given a list of edges (a, b,
t), describing the time t it takes for a message to be sent from node a to node 
b. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a
neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node
to receive a message that begins at node 0. 

For example, given N = 5, and the following edges:

edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]


You should return 9, because propagating the message from 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 will
take that much time.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each
letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as 0101 or 111110,
where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a
binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps
to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds
to a 0 in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to 1.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s


With this encoding, cats would be represented as 0000110111.

determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

remain will be prime.

 * It must not connect two keys by jumping over a third key, unless that key has
   already been used.

For example, 4 - 2 - 1 - 7 is a valid pattern, whereas 2 - 1 - 7 is not.

Find the total number of valid unlock patterns of length N, where 1 <= N <= 9.

Blackjack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack] is a two player card game
whose rules are as follows:

 * The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
 * The player can then ""hit"", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so
   long as their total does not exceed 21.
 * The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise pass.
 * Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not
   exceeding 21 is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between 2 and 
10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces count as 1.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a
blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).

You are given N identical eggs and access to a building with k floors. Your task
is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to break, if dropped from
that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be dropped again. If an egg breaks
when dropped from the xth floor, you can assume it will also break when dropped
from any floor greater than x.

Write an algorithm that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in
the worst case, to identify this floor.

For example, if N = 1 and k = 5, we will need to try dropping the egg at every
floor, beginning with the first, until we reach the fifth floor, so our solution
will be 5.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right
the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:

 * The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
 * The horizontal distance of a left child is hd(parent) - 1.
 * The horizontal distance of a right child is hd(parent) + 1.

For example, for the following tree, hd(1) = -2, and hd(6) = 0.

             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8


The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal
distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance,
either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be [0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9].

Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a
row in a triangle of numbers. For example, [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]] represents
the triangle:

  1
 2 3
1 5 1


We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a
time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row.
For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

This problem was asked by Affirm.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in
chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you
could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number 
fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many
transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and fee = 2, you should return 9, since
you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4
dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4
dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.

Intervals can ""touch"", such as [0, 1] and [1, 2], but they won't be considered
overlapping.

For example, given the intervals (7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8), return 1 as the last
interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the
second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a
queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].
If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are
computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed
by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by
a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a
program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

You are given a starting state start, a list of transition probabilities for a
Markov chain, and a number of steps num_steps. Run the Markov chain starting
from start for num_steps and compute the number of times we visited each state.

For example, given the starting state a, number of steps 5000, and the following
transition probabilities:

[
  ('a', 'a', 0.9),
  ('a', 'b', 0.075),
  ('a', 'c', 0.025),
  ('b', 'a', 0.15),
  ('b', 'b', 0.8),
  ('b', 'c', 0.05),
  ('c', 'a', 0.25),
  ('c', 'b', 0.25),
  ('c', 'c', 0.5)
]


One instance of running this Markov chain might produce { 'a': 3012, 'b': 1656,
'c': 332 }.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest
path in the tree.

For example, given the following tree:

   a
  /|\
 b c d
    / \
   e   f
  / \
 g   h


and the weights: a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1, the
longest path would be c -> a -> d -> f, with a length of 17.

The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any
amount of children.

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner,
how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents
a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]


Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

 * Right, down, down, right
 * Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game with three rods and n disks, each a
different size.

All the disks start off on the first rod in a stack. They are ordered by size,
with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest one at the top.

The goal of this puzzle is to move all the disks from the first rod to the last
rod while following these rules:

 * You can only move one disk at a time.
 * A move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and
   placing it on top of another stack.
 * You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary to complete the Tower
of Hanoi. You should assume that the rods are numbered, with the first rod being
1, the second (auxiliary) rod being 2, and the last (goal) rod being 3.

For example, with n = 3, we can do this in 7 moves:

Move 1 to 3
Move 1 to 2
Move 3 to 2
Move 1 to 3
Move 2 to 1
Move 2 to 3
Move 1 to 3

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y+1),
    (x+1,y-1)


You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the
points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start
from the first point.

Example:

Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output: 2


It takes 1 step to move from (0, 0) to (1, 1). It takes one more step to move
from (1, 1) to (1, 2).

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value
of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:

 * set(key, value, time): sets key to value for t = time.
 * get(key, time): gets the key at t = time.

The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will
maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. In other
words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for
that key set at the most recent time.

Consider the following examples:

d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2


d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1


d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater
permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not
greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest
value/ordering.

For example, the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]. The list [1,3,2] should
return [2,1,3]. The list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3].

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the
input memory)?

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum
number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from
top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is
lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each
row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

cba
daf
ghi


This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second
column to make it ordered:

ca
df
gi


So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

abcdef


Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only
one row).

As another example, given the following table:

zyx
wvu
tsr


Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to
order it.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array
where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if
0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X
appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the
multiplication table looks like this:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a
path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path.
For example, if a path in the graph goes through ""ABACA"", the value of the path
is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path
of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character
represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. Each tuple in the edge list 
(i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node.
Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.

For example, the following input graph:

ABACA


[(0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 4)]


Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices [0, 2, 3, 4], (A, A, C, A)
.

The following input graph:

A


[(0, 0)]


Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.

On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same
diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them,
i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M
chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack
each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the
same as (2, 1).

For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

 * (0, 0)
 * (1, 2)
 * (2, 2)
 * (4, 0)

The board would look like this:

[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]


You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops
3 and 4.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how ""out of order"" an array A is by counting the number of
inversions it has. Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] 
but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than
O(N^2) time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has
three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten
inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.

Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square
cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules
apply:

 * Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
adjacent.

Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a
starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run
for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since
it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the
top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.

You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (*) and a dead cell with a dot (.

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character
insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the
other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three:
substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.

Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in
the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off
to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic
idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and
character. For example, the string ""AAAABBBCCDAA"" would be encoded as
""4A3B2C1D2A"".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be
encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can
assume the string to be decoded is valid.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer
line length k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully
justified.

More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There
should be at least one space between each word. Pad extra spaces when necessary
so that each line has exactly length k. Spaces should be distributed as equally
as possible, with the extra spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.

If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side
with spaces.

Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.

For example, given the list of words [""the"", ""quick"", ""brown"", ""fox"", ""jumps"",
""over"", ""the"", ""lazy"", ""dog""] and k = 16, you should return the following:

[""the  quick brown"", # 1 extra space on the left
""fox  jumps  over"", # 2 extra spaces distributed evenly
""the   lazy   dog""] # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly

430,Sunday,10/21/2018,Daily Coding Problem <founders@dailycodingproblem.com>,How to Pick a Random Element from an Infinite Stream  ,"*Coding Challenge* 

Hey there,

Hope your interview practicing is going well! Let's work through the problem of
uniformly picking a random element from a gigantic stream. This is a common
interview question at companies like Google and Facebook.

Naively, we could process the stream and store all the elements we encounter in
a list, find its size, and pick a random element from [0, size - 1]. The problem
with this approach is that it would take O(N) space for a large N.

Instead, let's attempt to solve using loop invariants. On the ith iteration of
our loop to pick a random element, let's assume we already picked an element
uniformly from [0, i - 1]. In order to maintain the loop invariant, we would
need to pick the ith element as the new random element at 1 / (i + 1) chance.
For the base case where i = 0, let's say the random element is the first one.
Then we know it works because

 * For i = 0, we would've picked uniformly from [0, 0].
 * For i > 0, before the loop began, any element K in [0, i - 1] had 1 / i 
   chance of being chosen as the random element. We want K to have 1 / (i + 1) 
   chance of being chosen after the iteration. This is the case since the chance
   of having being chosen already but not getting swapped with the ith element
   is1 / i * (1 - (1 / (i + 1))) which is 1 / i * i / (i + 1) or 1 / (i + 1)

Let's see how the code would look:

import random

def pick(big_stream):
    random_element = None

    for i, e in enumerate(big_stream):
        if i == 0:
            random_element = e
        if random.randint(1, i + 1) == 1:
            random_element = e
    return random_element


Since we are only storing a single variable, this only takes up constant space!

Turns out this algorithm is called Reservoir Sampling
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling]. If you liked this problem

 * unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should
   return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would
like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is
no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is
the height of the tree.

438,Sunday,10/14/2018,Daily Coding Problem <founders@dailycodingproblem.com>,An Introduction To Backtracking  ,"*Coding Challenge* 

Hey there,

Today I'd like to give you some tips on how to solve backtracking questions.
Backtracking is an effective technique for solving algorithmic problems. In
backtracking, we search depth-first for solutions, backtracking to the last
valid path as soon as we hit a dead end.

Backtracking reduces the search space since we no longer have to follow down any
paths we know are invalid. This is called pruning. We must be able to test
partial solutions: for example, we can't find a global optimum using
backtracking, since we have no idea if the solution we're currently on can lead
to it or not. But we can, for example, solve Sudoku using backtracking. We can
know immediately if our solution so far is invalid by testing if two of the same
number appear in the same row, column, or square.

Let's go through several examples of problems that can be nicely solved with
backtracking to drill this concept down.

1. THE N QUEENS PUZZLE
The N queens puzzle is the classic backtracking problem. The question is this:

You have an N by N board. Write a function that returns the number of possible
arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without
threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or
diagonal.

Before continuing, you should take some time to try to solve it on your own!

First off, let's describe the brute force solution to this problem, which means
trying every single combination of N queens in each of N * N spots. That's n2 
choose n, which is painfully slow. We can immediately improve the runtime of
this algorithm by noticing that there's no point in ever placing two queens on
the same row (or column), so we really only need to have one queen per row. Now,
using brute force, we need to iterate over each row and over each spot on each
row. Since we have N rows and N columns, our runtime will be O(NN). That's still
hella slow, though.

It's helpful to ask ourselves three questions to determine whether we can apply
backtracking to a problem.

CAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?
Yes, we can tentatively place queens on the board.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?
Yes, we can check a solution is invalid if two queens threaten each other. To
speed this up, we can assume that all queens already placed so far do not
threaten each other, so we only need to check if the last queen we added attacks
any other queen.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?
Yes, we know a solution is complete if all N queens have been placed.

Now that we are confident that we can use backtracking, let's apply it to this
problem. We'll loop through the first row and try placing a queen in column
0..N, and then the second, and so on up until N. What differs here from brute
force is that we'll be adding the queens incrementally instead of all at once.

We'll create an is_valid function that will check the board on each incremental
addition. is_valid will look at the last queen placed and see if any other queen
can threaten it. If so, then we prune the branch since there's no point pursuing
it. Otherwise, we'll recursively call ourselves with the new incremental
solution. We only stop once we hit the base case: we've placed all queens on the
board already.

We can represent our board as just a 1D array of integers from 1..N, where the
value at the index i that represents the column the queen on row i is on. Since
we're working incrementally, we don't even need to have the whole board
initialized. We can just append and pop as we go down the stack.

Here's the actual code in Python:

def n_queens(n, board=[]):
    if n == len(board):
        return 1

    count = 0
    for col in range(n):
        board.append(col)
        if is_valid(board):
            count += n_queens(n, board)
        board.pop()
    return count

def is_valid(board):
    current_queen_row, current_queen_col = len(board) - 1, board[-1]
    # Check if any queens can attack the last queen.
    for row, col in enumerate(board[:-1]):
        diff = abs(current_queen_col - col)
        if diff == 0 or diff == current_queen_row - row:
            return False
    return True


Let's try it out.

for i in range(10):
    print(n_queens(i))
1
1
0
0
2
10
4
40
92
352


Looks correct, according to OEIS [https://oeis.org/A000170]!

2. FLIGHT ITINERARY PROBLEM
The flight itinerary problem is as follows:

Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as
(origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's
itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. All flights must be used in
the itinerary.

For example, given the following list of flights:

 * HNL ➔ AKL
 * YUL ➔ ORD
 * ORD ➔ SFO
 * SFO ➔ HNL

and starting airport YUL, you should return YUL ➔ ORD ➔ SFO ➔ HNL ➔ AKL. (This
also happens to be the actual itinerary for the trip I'm about to take.)

You should take some time to try to solve it on your own! Notice that a greedy
solution won't work, since it's possible to have a cycle in the graph.

Let's again describe the brute force solution to this problem, which is to try
every permutation of flights and verify that it's a valid itinerary. That would
be O(n!). Now let's ask ourselves if we can improve this with backtracking.

CAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?
Yes, we can build an (incomplete) itinerary and extend it by adding more flights
to the end.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?
Yes, we can check a solution is invalid if 1) there are no flights leaving from
our last destination and 2) there are still flights remaining that can be taken.
Since we must use all flights, this means we're at a dead end.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?
Yes, we can check if a solution is complete if our itinerary uses all the
flights.

Let's use this to construct our solution:

def get_itinerary(flights, current_itinerary):
    # If we've used up all the flights, we're done
    if not flights:
        return current_itinerary
    last_stop = current_itinerary[-1]
    for i, (origin, destination) in enumerate(flights):
        # Make a copy of flights without the current one to mark it as used
        flights_minus_current = flights[:i] + flights[i + 1:]
        current_itinerary.append(destination)
        if origin == last_stop:
            return get_itinerary(flights_minus_current, current_itinerary)
        current_itinerary.pop()
    return None


3. SUDOKU
Here's the problem: solve a well-posed sudoku puzzle.

Let's try using backtracking:

CAN WE CONSTRUCT A PARTIAL SOLUTION?
Yes, we can fill in some portions of the board.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE PARTIAL SOLUTION IS INVALID?
Yes, we can check that the board is valid so far if there are no rows, columns,
or squares that contain the same digit.

CAN WE VERIFY IF THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE?
Yes, the solution is complete when the board has been filled up.

Let's try to solve it using our template. We'll try filling each empty cell one
by one, and backtrack once we hit an invalid state. That'll look something like
this:

EMPTY = 0

def sudoku(board):
    if is_complete(board):
        return board

    r, c = find_first_empty(board)
    # set r, c to a val from 1 to 9
    for i in range(1, 10):
        board[r][c] = i
        if valid_so_far(board):
            result = sudoku(board)
            if is_complete(result):
                return result
        board[r][c] = EMPTY
    return board

def is_complete(board):
    return all(all(val is not EMPTY for val in row) for row in board)

def find_first_empty(board):
    for i, row in enumerate(board):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == EMPTY:
                return i, j

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array,
compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7,
8, 8], since:

 * 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
 * 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
 * 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
 * 8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and
you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you
compute them.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"" represents:

dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext


The directory dir contains an empty sub-directory subdir1 and a sub-directory 
subdir2 containing a file file.ext.

The string 
""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"" 
represents:

dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext


The directory dir contains two sub-directories subdir1 and subdir2. subdir1 
contains a file file1.extand an empty second-level sub-directory subsubdir1. 
subdir2 contains a second-level sub-directorysubsubdir2 containing a file 
file2.ext.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to
a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the
longest absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"", and its length is
32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the
length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If
there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

446,Sunday,10/07/2018,Daily Coding Problem <founders@dailycodingproblem.com>,How to Formulaically Solve Tree Interview Questions  ,"*Coding Challenge* 

Hey there,

Today I'd like to give you some tips on how to solve tree-based interview
questions. Tree questions are very common at top tech company interviews. I had
two tree questions in my Google onsite interviews and one during my Facebook
onsite interviews. An awesome thing about them is that they can be formulaically
solved every single time. It doesn’t involve any genius insight. Let me show you
how.

Instead of being too abstract, let’s just dive right into an easy binary tree
question. Then I’ll walk through how to solve it and we can go into a harder
problem after:

> Given the root to a binary tree, count the total number of nodes there are.


Before we move on further, feel free to take a moment to think about the answer!

Solving any binary tree question involves just two steps.

First is solving the base case. This usually means solving the leaf node case (a
leaf node has no left or right children) or the null case. For the above
problem, we can see that a null should represent 0 nodes while a leaf node
should represent 1 node.

Second is the recursive step. Assuming you knew the solution to the left subtree
and the right subtree, how could you combine the two results to give you the
final solution? It’s important to not get caught up on how this works and just
have faith that it works. If you start tracing the recursion, you’re going to
needlessly use up time and energy during the interview. Intuitively though, it
works for similar reasons as why regular induction works. P(0) or the base case
works which causes P(1) or the leaf node to work which causes P(2) to work and
so on. For this problem, it’s easy to combine the results of the left and right
subtrees. Just add the two numbers and then another 1 for the root. Here’s the
code:

def count(node):
  return count(node.left) + count(node.right) + 1 if node else 0


You certainly won’t get a question this easy but the process is the same for
trickier problems. Here’s another problem:

> Given the root to a binary tree, return the deepest node.


Base case for this question actually can’t be null, because it’s not a real
result that can be combined (null is not a node). Here we should use the leaf
node as the base case and return itself.

The recursive step for this problem is a little bit different because we can’t
actually use the results of the left and right subtrees directly. So we need to
ask, what other information do we need to solve this question? It turns out if
we tagged with each subresult node their depths, we could get the final solution
by picking the higher depth leaf and then incrementing it:

def deepest(node):
    if node and not node.left and not node.right:
        return (node, 1) # Leaf and its depth

    if not node.left: # Then the deepest node is on the right subtree
        return increment_depth(deepest(node.right))
    elif not node.right: # Then the deepest node is on the left subtree
        return increment_depth(deepest(node.left))

    return increment_depth(
            max(deepest(node.left), deepest(node.right),
                    key=lambda x: x[1])) # Pick higher depth tuple and then increment its depth

def increment_depth(node_depth_tuple):
    node, depth = node_depth_tuple
    return (node, depth + 1)


Best of luck!

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps
at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you
can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

 * 1, 2, 1
 * 1, 1, 2
 * 2, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb
any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you
could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

454,Sunday,09/30/2018,Daily Coding Problem <founders@dailycodingproblem.com>,How To Solve a Hard Programming Interview Question  ,"*Coding Challenge* 

Hey there,

Hope your day is going well! I wrote a tutorial on how to solve hard interview
questions and thought you might be interested.

So let's go over the thought process for solving tricky coding interview
questions. I often find it's not enough to just be able to solve the problem;
you really need to vocalize your thought process. This shows that you're a
strong communicator and that you didn't just get lucky solving this one
particular problem.

The question we'll work through is the following: return a new sorted merged
list from K sorted lists, each with size N. Before we move on any further, you
should take some time to think about the solution!

 1. First, go through an example. This buys time, makes sure you understand the
    problem, and lets you gain some intuition for the problem. For example, if
    we had [[10, 15, 30], [12, 15, 20], [17, 20, 32]], the result should be [10,
    12, 15, 15, 17, 20, 20, 30, 32].
    
    
 2. Next, give any solution you can think of (even if it's brute force). It
    seems obvious that if we just flattened the lists and sorted it, we would
    get the answer we want. The time complexity for that would be O(KN log KN),
    since we have K * N total elements.
    
    
 3. The third step is to think of pseudocode—a high-level solution for the
    problem. This is where we explore different solutions. The things we are
    looking for are better space/time complexities but also the difficulty of
    the implementation. You should be able to finish the solution in 30 minutes.
    Here, we can see that we only need to look at K elements in each of the
    lists to find the smallest element initially. Heaps are great for finding
    the smallest element. Let's say the smallest element is E. Once we get E, we
    know we're interested in only the next element of the list that held E. Then
    we'd extract out the second smallest element and etc. The time complexity
    for this would be O(KN log K), since we remove and append to the heap K * N 
    times.
    
    
 4. Initialize the heap. In Python this this is just a list. We need K tuples.
    One for the index for which list among the list of lists the element lives;
    one for the element index which is where the element lives; and the value of
    the element. Since we want the key of the heap to be based on the value of
    the element, we should put that first in the tuple.
    
    
 5. While the heap is not empty we need to: * Extract the minimum element from
       the heap: (value, list index, element index)
     * If the element index is not at the
       last index, add the next tuple in the list index.
    
    

4. Write the actual code. Ideally, at this point, it should be clear how the
code should look like. Here's one example:

def merge(lists):
    merged_list = []

    heap = [(lst[0], i, 0) for i, lst in enumerate(lists) if lst]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    while heap:
        val, list_ind, element_ind = heapq.heappop(heap)

        merged_list.append(val)

        if element_ind + 1 < len(lists[list_ind]):
            next_tuple = (lists[list_ind][element_ind + 1],
                          list_ind,
                          element_ind + 1)
            heapq.heappush(heap, next_tuple)
    return merged_list


 5. Think of test cases and run them through your interviewer. This shows that
    you're willing to test your code and ensure it's robust. I like to think of
    happy cases and edge cases. Our original example would be a happy case. Edge
    cases might be.
    
     * lists is [].
     * lists only contains empty lists: [[], [], []].
     * lists contains empty lists and non-empty lists: [[], [1], [1,2]].
     * lists contains one list with one element: [[1]].
     * lists contains lists of varying size: [[1], [1, 3, 5], [1, 10, 20, 30,
       40]].
    
    
 6. Finally, the interviewer should ask some follow-up questions. One common
    question is: what other solutions are there? There's actually another
    relatively simple solution that would use a divide-and-conquer strategy. We
    could recursively merge each half of the lists and then combine the two
    lists. This would have the same asymptotic complexities but would require
    more ""real"" memory and time.
    
    

Doing all these steps will definitely help you crystallize your thought process,
grasp the problem better, and show that you are a strong communicator and help
you land that job offer!

Best of luck!

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and
last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and 
cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

Given this implementation of cons:

def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):

Hi there,

Thanks for signing up to Daily Coding Problem! I hope you enjoy the problems we
send.

I'd like to take just a few moments to share with you what to expect from Daily
Coding Problem, and offer a few suggestions for how you can make the most of it.

We'll be sending you one programming interview question every day that was asked
recently by top tech companies. Each question should take under one hour to
solve, including actual working code and some tests. Here are a few suggestions
to get the most out of the problems:

 * Actually do the problems. This means writing the code and making it run.
   Getting stuck can be frustrating, but it's natural and the best way to learn.
 * Time yourself. Candidates who solve interview problems quickly are more
   likely to cinch the interview.
 * Think of edge cases and run your code through them. Some good edge cases
   might be the empty case, weird inputs, or a really large input.
 * Once you've made sure your code passes all your tests, try explaining your
   algorithm to a colleague or friend.
 * You could also start a mini-discussion group with your friends to discuss
   each day's problem.
 * Forward a problem to people you think might enjoy it, and discuss potential
   solutions with them.

470,Sunday,01/12/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,9 Tips To Ace Your Product Management Interview  ,"*Product Management Prep* 

You've done all the practice and now comes the day of your actual interview. Are
you ready? Here are some tips to help you remain confident to execute
successfully on the day of your product interview. Here are 9 tips to help you
land your dream job in product management!

The journey to the solution is oftentimes more important than the solution
itself. Make sure you're clear, convincing and concise. These tips can be broken
down into 3 sections:

 1. Ask clarifying questions
 2. Stop, Breathe, and Think (SBT)
 3. Summarize succinctly

Many times candidates either attempt to answer without full information leading
to poor assumptions/judgment, ramble on endlessly, or fail to articulate a
specific point. This can be detrimental to your candidacy since it reflects
poorly on your ability to communicate and articulate a story. As much as proper
feature selection is important, product managers must be clear and convincing
communicators and interviewers will be looking for these qualities.

ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
Before jumping into your solution, take some time to seek more information from
your interviewer. Besides providing you with more information, it serves three
other main purposes:

 * It helps eliminate thought streams that the interviewer isn't testing. For
   example, let's say you're working through a product improvement question.
   After identifying the key user groups, you may ask if there's a particular
   group the interviewer would like you to focus on. This can help eliminate
   unnecessary scope in your answer.
   
   
 * It gives you time to think. By asking questions, you can help shape your
   thinking and take valuable time to structure your solution ahead of time.
   
   
 * And more than anything, it shows you're exhaustive and thoughtful in your
   product approach. A large part of a product manager's role is information
   gathering. Show the interviewer you're curious and exhaustive when gathering
   information.
   
   

STOP, BREATHE, AND THINK (SBT)
Oftentimes the ones who fail product interviews are the ones who try to occupy
the entire interview time with sound. I often encourage candidates to slow down,
take time to think, and structure their thoughts. Taking time to think and
having silence can feel uncomfortable, but it always leads to a better solution
because it affords you time to be thoughtful and intentional in your answer.

To prevent yourself from rambling, keep these tips in mind:

 * Immediately ask for time to think. I always recommend starting off any
   product problem with a period of time to collect your thoughts and think
   about how to approach the solution. This creates immediate understanding
   between you and your interviewer that you value thinking thoroughly before
   jumping into a solution. A simple request such as, ""That's a great question,
   do you mind if I take 30 seconds to collect my thoughts?"" goes a long way.
   
   
 * The 1 Minute Check. Oftentimes we ramble at the beginning of our answers
   because we're not finished formulating our thoughts so we try to think and
   talk simultaneously. Bad combo. The 1 Minute Check is to take a mental pause
   after about 1 minute of talking to see if you're making sense or if you're
   rambling. Are you rambling? Ask for time to recollect your thoughts and slow
   down the pace.
   
   
 * Take notes. Give yourself the opportunity to write down notes, sketch
   solutions, or work through math equations with pen and paper. This helps slow
   down the pace and gives you more space to think clearly as you write things
   down. It also allows you to come back to your notes if you get lost or start
   to ramble to help recenter your thinking.
   
   

SUMMARIZE SUCCINCTLY
Summarizing your thoughts is important at driving home key takeaways that you
want the interviewer to remember. It's important to keep in mind three things
when summarizing your product solution in a product manager interview:

 * Be succinct. A good rule of thumb is you should only spend 15 - 30 seconds
   summarizing your solution. That's the equivalent to about 3 sentences.
   
   
 * Be chronological. Your summary should follow the same order as you presented
   them. It helps the interviewer remember the structure of your presentation
   and thus helps with information retention.
   
   
 * What's the key takeaway? While being succinct and chronological, you want to
   hammer home the one or two key takeaways from your answer. Be clear and
   articulate when saying the main points during your summary.
   
   

Product interviews are difficult and can be quite draining. It requires immense
focus and critical thinking for long periods of time. With these tips you can
feel more confident and energized while working through each problem.

Good luck!

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Square.

A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his
house, with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then
entirely downhill.

Given a dictionary of places of the form {location: elevation}, and a dictionary
mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances,
find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the
runner's home is location 0.

For example, suppose you are given the following input:

elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
paths = {
    (0, 1): 10,
    (0, 2): 8,

This problem was asked by Uber.

You have N stones in a row, and would like to create from them a pyramid. This
pyramid should be constructed such that the height of each stone increases by
one until reaching the tallest stone, after which the heights decrease by one.
In addition, the start and end stones of the pyramid should each be one stone
high.

You can change the height of any stone by paying a cost of 1 unit to lower its
height by 1, as many times as necessary. Given this information, determine the
lowest cost method to produce this pyramid.

For example, given the stones [1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1], the optimal solution is to pay

500,Sunday,01/26/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,How To Prepare For Your First Product Management Interview ,"*Product Management Prep* 

Getting the job is hard. Landing the interview sometimes feels even harder. Here
are 3 tips to help you land the product interview of your dreams.

By following these 3 tips, we're sure you'll increase your chances at landing
the product interview:

 1. Keep it concise with the Action-Result method on your resume.
 2. Leverage informational interviews.
 3. Relevance stands out.

Product isn't a space where randomly firing off a resume will give you good
results. Instead, be meticulous and purposeful when applying to jobs. You'll
want to communicate you're a great fit both based on your experience as well as
your passion for the space. After all, product managers need to be the most
driven and passionate people about the products they drive.

KEEP IT CONCISE WITH THE ACTION-RESULT METHOD ON YOUR RESUME
The Action-Result method is a condensed version of the STAR method
(Situation-Task-Action-Result). Here you focus on the actions you performed and
how they impacted the business. Remember, the average resume is screened for
under 10 seconds, and so you want to ensure you standout no matter which line
they glance over.

Here's the Action-Result method:

 * Action: Given the task at hand, how did you accomplish it? Once again, be
   clear and concise.
   
   
 * Result: This is the most important part of the A-R method. Here you'll want
   to describe using relevant metrics what your impact was from completing the
   task. This is how you communicate you are a high performer.
   
   

An example: Launched Facebook Messenger from concept to launch, a way for users
to message each other privately within the app, increasing D60 retention by 65%
and user stickiness by 325%.

Here, the applicant clearly describes what they did (launch Facebook Messenger),
and the direct result from their action (increasing D60 retention and
stickiness). It's important when you articulate your result that you use numbers
- they help communicate their story with more impact and believability.

LEVERAGE INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS
Networking can be tiring and arduous, but it does improve your chances of
landing an interview. Specifically, reaching out directly to members of the
product team rather than HR will increse your chances. By reaching out to
members of the product team, you're able to leverage conversations from
informational interviews.

Here, you can ask more about the product process, culture, and problems they're
solving. This can help you tailor both your resume and cover letter when
applying to different gigs.

Informational interviews also express interest and are more casual than pure
recruitment networking. This helps create a bridge of familiarity that otherwise
would not be present before applying.

RELEVANCE STANDS OUT
When you're applying for specific jobs, it's important to stand out. One way to
stand out is to be as relevant as possible in your resume. Having a resume
template is fine, but sending the same one to every job you apply for will lower
your chances of getting your dream job.

You should tailor your resume for each position you're applying for and focus on
the most relevant pieces of experience. It can be tedious to do so, but it will
increase your chances of landing your dream job. For example, if you're applying
for a technical PM role, it may be useful to highlight your technical experience
alongside your product experience.

Landing a product interview is sometimes as hard as getting the job. Increase
your chances by following our three tips for success!

Good luck!

532,Sunday,02/09/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,4 Tips To Make Your Product Interview More Conversational ,"*Product Management Prep* 

One of the most difficult parts of any interview is making your interview sound
more like a conversation. It depends not only on your ability to build rapport,
but also your ability to read signals from your interviewer - all of whom react
differently. Making your interviewer more comfortable helps your chances at
passing on to the next round. By establishing a conversational tone, you're
creating a situation that fosters rapport, empathy, and collaboration.

Here we'll go through four actionable tips you can use to make your product
management interview more conversational.

By following these four tips, we're sure you can build rapport and have more of
a dialogue during your interview:

 1. Ask for their opinion and ask open-ended questions.
 2. Mirror body language.
 3. Use 'we' terminology.
 4. Treat case questions as brainstorming sessions.

Use these simple tips and you'll be sure to create a more amicable experience
during your product management interview.

ASK FOR THEIR OPINION AND ASK OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS
The first method to creating a more conversational product interview is to look
for opportunities to ask two things:

 * For their opinion
 * Open-ended questions

By asking for your interviewers opinion, you explicitly invite opportunities for
your interviewer to jump in. Furthermore, people want to feel heard and
validated. By listening intently to their opinions on specific matters, you
increase the total amount of opportunities you can empathize with them and show
interest.

The second thing you should be asking is open-ended questions. Rather than
yes/no questions, open-ended questions forces the interviewer to talk in a
larger capacity. In a setting that's primarily you talking, this opens up
opportunities to look for 'nuggets', or areas we can probe deeper, that the
interviewer may want you to investigate.

It's important to use these tactics at the right moments - you shouldn't ask for
their opinion on answers and you shouldn't ask an open-ended question to divert
attention, but more so to extend the conversation. For example, after answering
an Improve a Product question, you may ask an open-ended question on something
specific, like how the interviewer might implement this improvement at their
company if the idea was pushed through.

Some examples of how to ask open-ended and opinion questions are as follows:

 * ... and that's how I'd improve the iPhone. Actually, out of curiosity what's
   the process like if we actually wanted to implement changes like these?
 * ... this strategy mainly focuses on engagement. I'd love to know, given
   you're in charge of retention, what do you think are tactics we could use to
   improve retention with this?
 * ... and those were the main reasons why I thought Facebook acquired
   Instagram. What do you think was the main reason?

MIRROR BODY LANGUAGE
The next tactic indirectly promotes more conversation in an interview. By
mirroring body language, you subconsciouly create a more welcoming environment.
It makes you appear more empathetic and therefore allows the interviewer to be
more open and vulnerable with you. You can use this to your advantage by trying
to ask for their opinion on topics after mirroring their body language for a
bit.

Now mirroring doesn't mean to copy exactly - this can backfire and come off
disingenuous or creepy. Instead, mirroring means to show similar body language.
For example, if the interviewer gives you a small smile or smirk, you might
smile with your eyes and continue to smile while talking.

USE 'WE' TERMINOLOGY
Using what we call 'we' terminology helps create instant rapport. If an
interviewer asks you how you might implement a feature, you would use 'we'
instead of 'I'. For example, 'We could set a meeting with the engineering team
first', instead of 'I would set a meeting with the engineering team first'.

By using 'we' terminology, you're creating a subconscious anchor that suggests
you're already part of the team. This opens the interviewer up to more
collaborative conversation rather than interogative conversation. By switching
the conversation from an interogative tone to a more collaborative tone, you're
able to more freely ask for their opinions during the interview.

TREAT CASE QUESTIONS AS BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS
The last tip we have is to treat all case questions as brainstorming sessions.
Typically in a case interview question (such as Design a Product or Expansion 
questions), there are two clear roles: the asker and the answerer. In real work
scenarios however, you're more likely to have a more collaborative experience in
these meetings akin to a brainstorming session. Just because it's an interview
doesn't mean you can't use this similar mindset.

By approaching case questions as brainstorming questions, you're able to bounce
ideas back and forth and enrich the solutions to your answers. Especially in
product management interviews, this is critically important. By collaborating in
this method, you're opening up more lines of communication with your interviewer
which only increases your chances of successfully answering these questions.

Brainstorming sessions are also a lot more inviting and enjoyable for the
interviewer than any type of one-way interrogation.

Landing a product management job at top tech companies like Amazon, Facebook,
and Airbnb isn't easy. With these four tips on creating a more conversational
interview though, you can improve your chances!

Good luck!

548,Sunday,02/16/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,"What To Do When You're Going To Miss A Deadline As A Product
 Manager ","*Product Management Prep* 

We've all worked on a project where we knew we'd miss the deadline. We've also
all probably stayed up late trying to hit those deadlines anyway. This is common
for many product managers throughout their career, and it's one of the most
stressful situations you can be in as a product manager.

Asking (or forcing?) your team to stay late to hit those deadlines only
accomplishes two things: it burns them out quicker, and it fosters resentment
towards you. You can maybe do this once or twice each year, but neither of these
are feasible if you're looking to cultivate a healthy and lasting relationship
with your engineering teams.

So, the question becomes what do you do? Well as a product manager it's your job
to figure these problems out, and sometimes you'll unfortunately need to have
difficult conversations with certain stakeholders.

Regardless, there's only 3 ways to sustainably hit seemingly impossible
deadlines:

 * Reduce Scope
 * Get More Resources
 * Get More Time

Here we'll go over each in detail, including who it impacts and how to
effectively implement each strategy.

REDUCE SCOPE
One of the three ways to hit impossible deadlines is to reduce scope. This means
to remove features or functionality from your product to hit the deadline. This
is usually the most demoralizing option, yet also the most realistic option.

The stakeholders this solution impacts the most are sales, account managers,
direct product reports, and your customers.

To effectively reduce scope you need to do the following things in this order:

 * List out all features and label them either: Must Haves, Should Haves, or
   Nice To Haves.
 * Immediately get your engineering team to focus on Must Haves first, then
   Should Haves, then Nice To Haves.
 * List out the cost of each feature and the status of completion for each
   feature.
 * Create a plan documenting which features you'll hit with your team, what you
   need to de-scope, and how you'll communicate this to stakeholders.
 * Communicate with your 1-up and 2-up (Director of Product and VP of Product,
   for example) this particular plan and get their input on priority. Take their
   edits into consideration. Here, it's important to be as upfront as possible.
   They're likely going to try to scope in more, but if you're not going to hit
   the deadlines don't fold here and promise something you know your team won't
   be able to accomplish.
 * Loop in all people immediately affected. If you're building a B2B SaaS
   product, this likely means your account managers and sales. If you're
   building a consumer app, it likely means your communication, support and
   marketing teams.
 * If you're building a B2B product, you'll need to formulate a communication
   strategy with your sales and account management teams to effectively
   communicate the news to potential and existing customers.
 * Communicate to your team the revised scope.
 * Execute to hit your revised scope.

GET MORE RESOURCES
The next strategy is to get more engineering resources. Unless your deadline is
months away, hiring new engineers is usually not realistic. So where do you get
the additional resource(s)? You'll need to pull from a different team by
negotiating with their product manager and your direct reports. Here, you risk
hurting your relationship with other product teams, and should only be used if
you can create a reasonable strategy and if the features you're building are
objectively more valuable to the company.

Here you'll want to focus on aligning each stakeholder on the organizaton's core
goal. Other teams will feel slighted, but reminding them you're all working
together towards this common goal can help.

The stakeholders it affects most are other product teams, your engineering team,
and your direct reports.

To effectively negotiate for more resources, you should do the following in
order:

 * List out all features and label them either: Must Haves, Should Haves, or
   Nice To Haves.
 * List out the cost of each feature and the status of completion for each
   feature.
 * Calculate the value of building your feature to your core product and
   organizational metrics (for example, top-line revenue, MAU, growth, etc.).
 * List out all other product teams, their engineering resources, and the value
   of their features to the organization.
 * Create a plan that outlines how many more resources you'll need and which
   teams are most likely to contribute based on value.
 * Communicate with your 1-up and 2-up your plan, outlining why you'll need more
   resources and which features are at risk. Work on finalizing any resource
   plans together.
 * Directly reach out to the product team you're looking to borrow resources
   from and explain the situational need for more resources. Here, make sure to
   focus on how appreciative you are, rather than simply outlining that your
   features are more valuable - no one wants to hear that even if it's true.
 * If you are granted more resources, now is time to onboard them. Do this with
   an intro meeting with your engineering team lead. Explain the situation and
   start pushing certain responsibilites over to the new developer.
 * Execute to hit your revised scope.
 * Show appreciation to the other team that you've borrowed resources from. They
   did you a huge favor and they deserve to be acknowledged. You can do this by
   expressing a heartfelt thank you, publically acknowleding them to other
   teams, or repay them in the future by lending resources when they need it
   more than you.

GET MORE TIME
This is the most obvious strategy, yet oftentimes the least realistic. We've
promised certain features by a certain date and now you can't meet the specified
date, so you ask for an extension. This is another undesirable scenario. It's
important for this to consider code freezes, company-wide release policies, and
potential affected customers.

The stakeholders this solution affects the most are sales, account managers, QA,
marketing, and your customers.

To effectively push deadlines, you should do the following:

 * List out all features and label them either: Must Haves, Should Haves, or
   Nice To Haves.
 * List out the cost of each feature and the status of completion for each
   feature.
 * Create a plan with three different milestones: one to hit all Must Haves, one
   to hit all Must Haves and Should Haves, and one to hit everything.
 * Set a meeting with your direct reports and outline your proposed milestones.
   Here, you'll spend time negotiating and reprioritizing certain features by
   certain dates. Since you've costed out all features, you'll know what's
   realistic. Do not overpromise - you've already missed one deadline and you do
   not want to miss another.
 * Communicate your new scope based on your revised deadline to your team
   immediately. Explain how you're unlikely to hit the deadline and so you've
   negotiated for more time.
 * Execute to hit your revised scope.

WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
If you're running into this issue often, it likely means you're not effectively
tracking how much work your team can accomplish, you're not accounting for
enough edge cases in your product spec, or you're unable to effectively manage
your stakeholders' expectations. The best strategy is always to be preventative
rather than reactionary.

Regardless, by following these strategies, you accomplish four critical goals in
a bad situation:

 1. You take responsibility early, creating trust and respect with all parties
 2. You communicate unified expectations to everyone involved, limiting
    potential backlash
 3. You create a collaborative situation with all stakeholders, limiting blame
    and internal fighting
 4. You build trust and respect with your engineering team, limiting resentment
    and burnout

This is the best-case scenario out of a worst-case scenario.

Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square
cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules
apply:

 * Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
 * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
 * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
 * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
adjacent.

Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a
starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run
for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since
it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the
top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.

You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (*) and a dead cell with a dot (.

564,Sunday,02/23/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,4 Tips To Network Effectively ,"*Product Management Prep* 

Networking is a useful skill whether you're looking for a job or just looking to
meet people in the industry. It can open doors for you in the future and forge
solid friendships or business relationships. One thing people struggle with is
the actual art of networking. It's not as simple as grabbing a coffee with
someone and firing off a list of questions - there's way more to it.

By following these four tips, we're sure you can create more fruitful networking
sessions and forge stronger relationships with people:

 * Have a purpose and be direct
 * Ask about things outside the 9 - 5
 * Continuing the chain
 * Follow up!

HAVE A PURPOSE AND BE DIRECT
Too many times have people asked us for coffee without a clear purpose. Before
asking someone to network you should first ask yourself, ""What do I event want?
"". If you're unable to answer that question, then you might want to rethink
grabbing a coffee with someone.

Once you do have a good reason to network with someone, it's just as important
to be direct. Let them know why you're reaching out. It's okay if your needs
seem selfish at first - if you're looking to learn more about a job at a
company, say it! There's no use beating around the bush because if someone
agrees to meet you, it's so they can offer their help in ways they think is
suitable. If you don't tell them what you specifically are looking to gain, they
won't know how to help you.

Here are some reasons why you might want to network with someone:

 * Learn more about a job and potentially get a referral
 * Learn more about product management or another field
 * Trying to be introduced to someone they know
 * Access to funding
 * Validate product ideas
 * An informal user interview
 * Gain a mentor in a space you're interested in
 * Asking about specific experiences they have

ASK ABOUT THINGS OUTSIDE THE 9-5
Lastly, even though networking is primarily business, there's a human element to
networking. Besides just talking, you're building a relationship with someone.
Asking about things outside of their work shows interest and makes things more
casual. By creating a more casual experience you open the door for more
empathetic interactions and come across as more likeable.

Adding a friendly element to your interactions creates more opportunity for the
other person to want to help you. It also creates an environment that breeds
honesty, directness, and comfortability. Treat them like how you'd treat a new
friend!

Some things you can ask outside the 9-5 include:

 * Any cool trips coming up?
 * Have you tried xyz?
 * Are you up to anything fun this weekend? Tell me about it!
 * What was the highlight of your week?

CONTINUING THE CHAIN
One tip we always recommend is called Continuing the Chain. Continuing the Chain
means you should always ask to be introduced to someone new. It's best to have
someone already in mind (looking at someone's LinkedIn beforehand helps a lot).
Alternatively you can ask based on specific experiences or examples you're
looking to draw from.

When continuing the chain, it's important to be specific. Just asking someone to
introduce you to someone random doesn't help either person. Instead you'll want
to reference specific things you're trying to learn and ask about those. Don't
be shy with this either - if you've impressed the person you just spoke to,
they'd be more than happy to introduce you to someone they know since it only
helps their reputation for connecting smart people.

Some questions to ask to continue the china:

 * Is there someone on the QA team you can introduce me to so I can learn more
   about their process?
 * I saw you were connected with Joe McKay on LinkedIn - I noticed he's started
   his own podcast and I'm interested in learning more about his journey. Can
   you introduce me?
 * I'm actually looking at a role at Airbnb, who on their product team do you
   know? Can you introduce me?
 * One area I'm looking to learn more about is marketplaces, who in your network
   would you recommend I talk to to learn more about marketplaces? Can you
   introduce me?
 * Who are the smartest people you know? Can you introduce me to them?

FOLLOW UP!
The networking session goes well, then time passes and you never talk again.
Sound familiar? Too many times do we start building a relationship with someone
and then stop following up with them. It's important to follow up with
connections you make to maintain a healthy network.

You should look to continually follow up with people you're connected with. It
doesn't need to be every week - but once every quarter to twice a year works
perfect. Even simple catch-ups over email are enough to maintain a positive
relationship with someone.

Networking can be difficult and draining, especially for those of us who are
more introverted. However, we promise that in the end it's worthwhile! Hopefully
these four tips help you network more effectively, especially as a product
manager. Have any other tips? Reach out and let us know :)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the
secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number
with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds
by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the
secret code. For example, if the secret code were 123456, then a guess of 175286 
would score two, since 1 and 6 were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores,
determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return True, since they
correspond to the secret code 123456:

{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}


However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in
this case you should return False:

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the
number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa',

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked
only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

 * is_locked, which returns whether the node is locked
 * lock, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should
   return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
 * unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should
   return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would
like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is
no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is
the height of the tree.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Yelp.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right
the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:

 * The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
 * The horizontal distance of a left child is hd(parent) - 1.
 * The horizontal distance of a right child is hd(parent) + 1.

For example, for the following tree, hd(1) = -2, and hd(6) = 0.

             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \

   /                /
  0                8


The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal
distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance,
either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be [0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9].

You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board.
Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you
can walk on.

Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum
number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is
no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You

[t, t, f, t],
[f, f, f, f],
[f, f, f, f]]


and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left), the minimum number

656,Sunday,04/05/2020,Daily Product Prep <daily@dailyproductprep.com>,4 Tips To Network Effectively ,"*Product Management Prep* 

Networking is a useful skill whether you're looking for a job or just looking to
meet people in the industry. It can open doors for you in the future and forge
solid friendships or business relationships. One thing people struggle with is
the actual art of networking. It's not as simple as grabbing a coffee with
someone and firing off a list of questions - there's way more to it.

By following these four tips, we're sure you can create more fruitful networking
sessions and forge stronger relationships with people:

 * Have a purpose and be direct
 * Ask about things outside the 9 - 5
 * Continuing the chain
 * Follow up!

HAVE A PURPOSE AND BE DIRECT
Too many times have people asked us for coffee without a clear purpose. Before
asking someone to network you should first ask yourself, ""What do I event want?
"". If you're unable to answer that question, then you might want to rethink
grabbing a coffee with someone.

Once you do have a good reason to network with someone, it's just as important
to be direct. Let them know why you're reaching out. It's okay if your needs
seem selfish at first - if you're looking to learn more about a job at a
company, say it! There's no use beating around the bush because if someone
agrees to meet you, it's so they can offer their help in ways they think is
suitable. If you don't tell them what you specifically are looking to gain, they
won't know how to help you.

Here are some reasons why you might want to network with someone:

 * Learn more about a job and potentially get a referral
 * Learn more about product management or another field
 * Trying to be introduced to someone they know
 * Access to funding
 * Validate product ideas
 * An informal user interview
 * Gain a mentor in a space you're interested in
 * Asking about specific experiences they have

ASK ABOUT THINGS OUTSIDE THE 9-5
Lastly, even though networking is primarily business, there's a human element to
networking. Besides just talking, you're building a relationship with someone.
Asking about things outside of their work shows interest and makes things more
casual. By creating a more casual experience you open the door for more
empathetic interactions and come across as more likeable.

Adding a friendly element to your interactions creates more opportunity for the
other person to want to help you. It also creates an environment that breeds
honesty, directness, and comfortability. Treat them like how you'd treat a new
friend!

Some things you can ask outside the 9-5 include:

 * Any cool trips coming up?
 * Have you tried xyz?
 * Are you up to anything fun this weekend? Tell me about it!
 * What was the highlight of your week?

CONTINUING THE CHAIN
One tip we always recommend is called Continuing the Chain. Continuing the Chain
means you should always ask to be introduced to someone new. It's best to have
someone already in mind (looking at someone's LinkedIn beforehand helps a lot).
Alternatively you can ask based on specific experiences or examples you're
looking to draw from.

When continuing the chain, it's important to be specific. Just asking someone to
introduce you to someone random doesn't help either person. Instead you'll want
to reference specific things you're trying to learn and ask about those. Don't
be shy with this either - if you've impressed the person you just spoke to,
they'd be more than happy to introduce you to someone they know since it only
helps their reputation for connecting smart people.

Some questions to ask to continue the china:

 * Is there someone on the QA team you can introduce me to so I can learn more
   about their process?
 * I saw you were connected with Joe McKay on LinkedIn - I noticed he's started
   his own podcast and I'm interested in learning more about his journey. Can
   you introduce me?
 * I'm actually looking at a role at Airbnb, who on their product team do you
   know? Can you introduce me?
 * One area I'm looking to learn more about is marketplaces, who in your network
   would you recommend I talk to to learn more about marketplaces? Can you
   introduce me?
 * Who are the smartest people you know? Can you introduce me to them?

FOLLOW UP!
The networking session goes well, then time passes and you never talk again.
Sound familiar? Too many times do we start building a relationship with someone
and then stop following up with them. It's important to follow up with
connections you make to maintain a healthy network.

You should look to continually follow up with people you're connected with. It
doesn't need to be every week - but once every quarter to twice a year works
perfect. Even simple catch-ups over email are enough to maintain a positive
relationship with someone.

Networking can be difficult and draining, especially for those of us who are
more introverted. However, we promise that in the end it's worthwhile! Hopefully
these four tips help you network more effectively, especially as a product
manager. Have any other tips? Reach out and let us know :)

Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the
list sum to K.

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return
[2, 3, 4], since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot k, partition the linked list so that
all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k. 

For example, given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3, the solution
could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the
intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the
node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node
objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and
constant space.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You have the entire social graph of Facebook users, with nodes representing
users and edges representing friendships between users. Given the edges of the
graph and the number of nodes, write a function to return the smallest number of
friendships in-between two users.

For example, if the graph consists of 5 users A, B, C, D, E, and the friendship
edges are: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (D, E) then the function should return 2 for
the input A and E.
